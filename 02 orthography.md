there is currently no main orthography and several systems exist. for the sake of convenience, latin script is used the most.
# latin
## consonants
consonants are written as they appear in the ipa, with a few exceptions:
- for cases where only ascii is allowed, /ŋ/ is written as ng 
- /fʰ/ and /sʰ/ are written as f and s (respectively)
- /x/ is written as h
- plosive codas are written as p, t and k (unvoiced forms)
- note that p/b, t/d and k/g are not distinguished as finals
	- for the purpose of standardisation, the former is preferred
## vowels
vowels are written as follows:

| light | neut | dark |
| :---: | :--: | :--: |
|   e   |  ə   |  i   |
|   a   |  ^   |  o   |
|   ō   |  ^   |  u   |

for cases where only ascii is allowed, vowels can be written as follows:

| light | neut | dark |
| :---: | :--: | :--: |
|   e   |  uh  |  i   |
|   a   |  ^   |  o   |
|  oh   |  ^   |  u   |

# syllabary
this is a hangul-inspired syllabary.
each syllable consists of the following:
- a shape on top to represent the initial
- a line in the middle to represent the medial and nucleus
- a shape at the bottom to represent the coda

## initial and coda
the initial and coda use the same shapes.
each shape consists of a base shape and a diacritic (line / dot).

the base shape is based on the placement of the consonant.
- square for bilabial consonants
- triangle for alveolar consonants
- circle for velar consonants

![[shapes.svg|m, n and ŋ respectively]]

the diacritics are as follows:
- line going to the left for voiced plosives
- line going to the right for unvoiced plosives
- line going down for fricatives
![[diacritics.svg|m, p, b and f respectively]]

in the case of plosives with no audible release functioning as finals, they are represented with a line going upwards to avoid leaning towards voiced/unvoiced plosives.

due to the fact that alveolar consonants are usually represented by a triangle, the diacritics look slightly different.

the main differences are that the line extends at a slightly different angle to meet the left and right lines of the triangle at their midpoints. there is also an extra diacritic, the dot, to represent l.
![[alveolar.svg|n, t, d, s, and l respectively]]

the top line still comes from the top, meeting the triangle at a corner instead of the midpoint of a line.

## medial and nucleus
the middle line can have 3 lines extending out from it.
- the line on the left represents the medial.
- the line in the middle represents the vowel class (high/mid/low).
- the line on the right represents the vowel group (dark/neut/light).

each line can either extend up or down, or not be present.

the medials w and y are represented with lines going up and down respectively.
![[medials.svg|ə, wə and yə respectively]]

the light vowels have a line going up on the right side. note that the middle line changes with the group (up for high, down for low).
![[light vowels.svg|e, a, and ō respectively]]

the dark vowels are similar, but the line on the right side goes down instead.
![[dark vowels.svg|i, o and u respectively]]

the vowel ə can be represented as a neutral vowel (no line on the right side) in any class (any line in the middle), but for the sake of simplicity, the middle line is usually omitted.
