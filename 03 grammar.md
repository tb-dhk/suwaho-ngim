# verb foundations

all words are built on verbs, which are then conjugated, nominalised or turned into modifiers.

each verb stem ends with -ə, and this -ə sound is changed based on the part of speech of the resulting word. whether the -ə sound is replaced with a light or dark vowel depends on the last vowel (before -ə). if there is no vowel before -ə, the dark vowel is used.

| resulting part of speech | vowel class | light | dark |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | ----- | ---- |
| noun                     | high        | e     | i    |
| verb                     | mid         | a     | o    |
| adverb/particle          | low         | ō     | u    |

here is a list of verb suffixes:

- forming nouns
    
    - -e/i: subject
        
    - -em/im: direct object
        
    - -el/il: nominalisation
        
        - -el.hō/il.hu: modifier (see [[#markers and basic verbs|hə]])
            
- forming verbs
    
    - infinitive verbs
        
        - -ə: infinitive
            
        - tense
            
            - -a/o.pə: past
                
            - -a/o.tə: present
                
            - -a/o.kə: future
                
    - conjugation (mood)
        
        - -a/o: stative
            
        - -a.ya/o.yo: interrogative
            
        - -a.la/o.lo: vocative/imperative
            
            - note that these can only be used on verbs in the present tense
                
- forming adverbs/particles
    
    - -ō/u: forms adverb/particle
        

adverbs only become particles when they are added at the end of a word.

note that tense does not have to be specified unless deemed necessary.

# pronouns

first, second and third person pronouns are also derived from the verbs _mə_, _nə_ and _ngə_, making them _mi_, _ni_ and _ngi_. _ngi_ can refer to any third person, including "this" or "that". _sə_ means "to be a thing", so _si_ refers to "a thing".

# markers and basic verbs
every noun in the sentence requires a suffix to indicate its case and/or its relation to the verb. these markers are derived from special verbs. the marker syllable should be stressed, and an dot (◌̣) should be placed under the vowel. this is for disambiguation from longer verbs that may end in similar syllables.

the following 11 verbs, along with _mə_, _nə_, _ngə_ and _sə_ (i.e. all verbs with structure _Cə_/_Gə_) are called tier 1 verbs. there are 15 tier 1 verbs.

| verb | meaning               | particle | particle meaning                         | case / role            |
| ---- | --------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| pə   | to use                | -pọ̄/pụ | using                                    | instrumental           |
| tə   | to be along with      | -tọ̄/tụ | along with                               | comitative             |
| kə   | to go (towards)       | -kọ̄/kụ | towards, ending at, for (the benefit of) | allative / benefactive |
| bə   | to come (from)        | -bọ̄/bụ | starting/originating from                | ablative               |
| də   | to be at              | -dọ̄/dụ | at, on, in                               | locative               |
| gə   | to be regarding       | -gọ̄/gụ | in regards to                            | topical                |
| fə   | to be compared (to)   | -fọ̄/fụ | than                                     | comparative            |
| hə   | to be of              | -họ̄/hụ | of                                       | genitive               |
| lə   | to be a subject       | -lọ̄/lụ | subject marker                           | nominative             |
| yə   | to be a direct object | -yọ̄/yụ | direct object marker                     | accusative             |
| wə   | to be an alternative  | -wọ̄/wụ | or, alternatively                        | disjunctive            |
_milụ nihụ so._ i am your thing / i am yours.  
_ngigụ milụ ko._ in regards to that, i am moving.

these verbs can also be used as the predicate of a clause. the stress rule still applies.
_milụ nihọ._ i am of you / i am yours.  
_milụ nikọ._ i am towards you / i am going to you.  

note that using these verbs as suffixes has the same meaning as if you were to use the bound noun as the object of the verb. for example, both _milụ nihọ_ and _milụ niyụ họ_ mean the same thing, but the former is preferred.
# word order

due to the presence of markers, word order is free. however, for the sake of standardisation, this guide will stick to SOV word order. in general, it is recommended that connectors come first, followed by the subject, and the verb should be at the end. however, this is not necessary.

there is a front-to-back order of emphasis as well, where whatever is in front is emphasised more.

# functional verbs

the following tier 2 verbs are often stacked with other verbs to create more complex meanings. there are 26 tier 2 verbs.

# connectors

for connectors, you can use the verb _ngə_ or _lyə_ along with a particle. some examples are:

| connector | translation | literal                 |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| ngigụ    | thus        | because of this         |
| ngitụ    | and         | along with this         |
| ngiwụ    | or          | this or                 |
| lyilgụ   | however     | in regards to being not |
# stacking verbs
to nest or stack verbs, e.g. i want to (go) or i need (you to do this), you can use nominalisation.
for example, "i want to go" can become "i want **the action of going**":
> milụ **kil**yụ dwo. 

or "i want **that i go**":
> milụ **milụ kil**yụ dwo.

"i need you to do this" can become "i need **you to do this**":
> milụ **nilụ ngil**yụ dyo.
 
# compound verbs

we can take the stacking a step further by merging the two verbs into one word, removing the *yu*. for example, "to cause to start" can be written as *pwilyụ kyə*, but it can be further shortened to *pwilkyə̣*. note that the first syllable of the second verb should be stressed.

# adverbs
to convert a verb into an adverb, you can use the *-ō/u* suffix. note that the adverb does not require any marker. verbs that are converted into adverbs can also hold subjects and objects, and can describe the verb itself or the subject.
